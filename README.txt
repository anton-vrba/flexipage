Abstract:
    The package flexipage allows easy page layout if marginalia is 
    required. Mid document changes are possible such as: new marginal 
    width, full width text, and landscape text without marginal. 
    Partners well with the package sidenotesplus. The package also 
    aids the layout for book printing, adding binding corrections 
    and adding page bleed, if required by the printers
